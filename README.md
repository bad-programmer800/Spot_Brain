# Spot_Brain
Science project 

The foundation of this project is Hazel Engine. The Cherno is amazing. As soon as I have glfw, Imgui, and Opengl I will branch into my own thing, but I really have no idea what I am doing!!!!!

At Commit #20, I made my very first non-Cherno element (I am currently up to Game Engine Ep. 40). It was just an empty ImGui window, but I'm very excited to figure out how to start passing different things into different windows and start gaining some extra functionality. Planning to play around with OpenCV in the near future.
